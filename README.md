# VirtualVoyager
  Web application built using Flask, MariaDB, HTML/CSS/JS, and Apache <br>
  It allows users to find trips based on a keyword such as "rock climbing" or "beaches" <br>
  Trips consist of 3-5 locations with info about what to do, eat, and see at each location. <br>
  Users can indicate whether they liked a trip which will then be used to recommend more trips that they may like. <br>
